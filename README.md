# republatfrags

This repository aims to contain usable plain text files of Latin authors who extensively preserve the fragmentary authors of the Roman Republic. Right now I have just Nonius up, but will add more soon.

### Goals: 

* to develop a database of the citation of Republican historians from the compilatory sources against which to compare the work I've done on the citation of Cato so far.

### Nonius data guide:
* <<!!>> brackets app crit (if retained)
* <<&&>> brackets page headers
* <<@>> sets off CAPITAL headwords 
* ?# sets off subheadings
* <<%>> intros grammatical topics
* j* is a dagger/obelisk 

## Updates:
* 4/2: added the tabularized Nonius and wrote more about it [here](https://evacarrara.github.io/evacarrara/2021/04/02/making-nonius-tabular.html). Updated the plain text.
* 3/23: created the repo and wrote more about it [here](https://evacarrara.github.io/evacarrara/2021/03/23/nonius-marcellus-plain-texts.html)
